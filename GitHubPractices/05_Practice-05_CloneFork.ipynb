    "1. **Fork Existing repository using UI**\n",
    "    - Created fork _(see repository https://github.com/inbrnthedj/gkpbt-css-circle.git)_ and exported it in a codespace to be made avaialble in the later steps by running:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "    export ORIGIN=https://github.com/inbrnthedj/gkpbt-css-circle.git\n",
    "```\n",

    "2. **Clone forked repository in the lab environment**\n",
    "    - clones the repository in current directory (in codespace)\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "    git clone $ORIGIN\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create a new branch**\n",

    "            git status\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "    - To check the changes, I used git diff and it showed exactly where the change was, indicating with color red what was deleted and with green what was added. It showed basically in red the old lines and in green the new lines:\n",

    "            git merge feature-circle-500\n",

    "            git log --oneline\n",
    "        ```\n",

    "7. **Create pull request to the upstream repository**\n",
    "    - navigate to the forked repository, ensure you are on the Code tab. Click contribute and then Open pull request\n",
    "    - it took me to \"Comparing Changes\" panel and showed the differences between the main branch of the fork and of the original repository.\n",
    "    - Click Create pull request button\n",
    "    - Add title and create pull request \n",
    "    - It told me that I've completed the lab."
