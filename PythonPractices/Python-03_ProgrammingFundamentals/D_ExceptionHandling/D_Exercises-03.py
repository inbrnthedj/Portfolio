Exercise 3: Handling Generic Exceptions

Imagine you have a number and want to perform a complex mathematical task. The calculation 
requires dividing the value of the input argument "num" by the difference between "num" 
and 5, and the result has to be stored in a variable called "result".

You have to define a function so that it can perform that complex mathematical task. 
The function should handle any potential errors that occur during the calculation. 
To do this, you can use a try-except block. If any exception arises during the calculation, 
it should catch the error using the generic exception class "Exception" as "e". 
When an exception occurs, the function should display "An error occurred during calculation.

def complex_calculation(num):
    try:
        result = num / (num - 5) # if I enter 5, it will become a ValueError
        print (f"Result: {result}")
    except Exception as e: 
        print("An error occurred during calculation.")
# Test case
user_input = float(input("Enter a number: "))
complex_calculation(user_input)
